machine learning based web application for predicting deliriums


More than 40% of patients aged over 60 are affected by the 
cognitive disorder postoperative delirium (pod). Such patients 
may experience disorientation, difficulty in speech and even memory loss. 
These cognitive disorders result in increased hospital stays with higher 
hospital costs and lower quality of life for patients. In order to give 
doctors the option to make more informed decisions prior to a patients surgery, 
I have developed a machine learning based solution with the goal to help doctors 
assessing the risk of a patient developing a pod. For this purpose, 
a Decision-Tree Model (RandomForest) combined with an AI Explainability
 model called SHAP has been applied to the medical patients data. 
The latter model opens the possibility to identify which feature of
 the patientâ€™s medical data has contributed on average to the final 
prediction on developing (or not developing) a pod. With this option, 
doctors have the option to come up with preventive measures before going 
ahead with a surgery for a specific patient.
